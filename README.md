# accidentdetection
This project is an accident detection system using Arduino Uno, ADXL335 accelerometer, GPS, and GSM modules. It detects sudden accelerations indicative of accidents, retrieves the vehicle's location via GPS, and sends an SMS alert with the location details to emergency contacts using the GSM module.
